# Nightfall
Repository for University of Sussex's Masters' Project, a 3D FPS Assassin game. Supervised by Dr. Paul Newbury.

## Overview

In this game, you play as an assassin tasked with eliminating all enemies within a given time frame. The enemies patrol along designated routes and will be alerted to your presence if they see you, at which point they will attack. As the player, you have three special abilities:

- **Blink**: Teleport a short distance to a targeted location.
- **Dark Vision**: See enemy silhouettes through objects, allowing you to locate and plan your approach.
- **Bend Time**: Slow down time, useful for escaping dangerous situations.

Each ability consumes mana, so strategic use of mana is crucial for success. At the start of the game, the player is provided with mana and health potions.

If you approach an enemy from behind without being detected, you can perform a finisher move that instantly kills them. If an enemy detects you, you can either escape their range and hide or engage in melee combat. The game also features a pistol mechanic, allowing you to switch from a sword to a pistol and shoot.

There are two types of enemies: melee and ranged (armed with pistols).
